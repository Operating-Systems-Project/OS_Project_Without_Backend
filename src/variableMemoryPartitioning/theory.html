            <h3> Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Any process must be loaded onto the main memory before it can be executed by the CPU. The operating
                system is
                responsible for allocation of all the necessary resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                In operating systems, memory management is the function responsible for allocating and managing a
                computerâ€™s
                main memory. It keeps track of the status of each memory location, whether they are allocated or free,
                no
                illegal references are being made etc to ensure efficient use of main memory.
            </p>
            <p> Main Memory refers to a physical memory that is the internal memory to the computer. The word
                main is used to distinguish it from external mass storage devices such as disk drives. Main
                memory is also known as RAM. The computer is able to change only data that is in main memory.
                Therefore, every program we execute and every file we access must be copied from a storage
                device into main memory.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Contiguous Memory Allocation</h3>
                <p>In contiguous memory allocation each process is contained in a single contiguous block of memory.
                    Memory is divided into several fixed size partitions. Each partition contains exactly one
                    process. When a partition is free, a process is selected from the input queue and loaded into
                    it. The free blocks of memory are known as holes. The set of holes is searched to determine
                    which hole is best to allocate.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Swapping</h3>
                <p>A process needs to be in memory for execution. But sometimes there is not enough main memory to
                    hold all the currently active processes in a timesharing system. So, excess process are kept on
                    disk and brought in to run dynamically. Swapping is the process of bringing in each process in
                    main memory, running it for a while and then putting it back to the disk.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Fragmentation</h3>
                <p>As processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory space is broken into little
                    pieces. It happens after sometimes that processes cannot be allocated to memory blocks
                    considering their small size and memory blocks remains unused. This problem is known as
                    Fragmentation.</p>
                <p>Fragmentation is of two types: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>External fragmentation</h3>
                        <p>Total memory space is enough to satisfy a request or to reside a process in it, but it is
                            not contiguous, so it cannot be used.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Internal fragmentation</h3>
                        <p>Memory block assigned to process is bigger. Some portion of memory is left unused, as it
                            cannot be used by another process.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <hr />
            <div>
                <p>
                    There are two techniques of memory management, contiguous and non-contiguous. We will be discussing
                    the
                    concepts
                    of contiguous memory allocation in this section, while the algorithms used and non-contiguous memory
                    allocation
                    in further sections. They are as follows:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Multiprogramming with Fixed Tasks (MFT)</h3>
                <img src="./pics/mft.png" alt="MFT">
                <p>This is the oldest and simplest technique designed to load multiple processes into
                    the main memory at once. The number of partitions in this technique is fixed, but the size of
                    individual
                    partitions may vary. Each process is loaded into one of the partitions.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Multiprogramming with Variable Tasks (MVT)</h3>
                <img src="./pics/mvt.png" alt="MVT">
                <p>Variable partitioning (MVT): In contrast to fixed partitioning, it aims at a more dynamic approach.
                    The
                    partitions in the main memory are not made before loading the process but are created during run
                    time. The
                    partition created is equal to the process loaded, so internal fragmentation is avoided.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Memory Allocation</h3>
                <p>Memory allocation is a process by which computer programs are assigned memory or space</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h5>First Fit</h5>
                        <p>The first hole that is big enough is allocated to program</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Best Fit</h5>
                        <p>The smallest hole that is big enough is allocated to program</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Worst Fit</h5>
                        <p>The largest hole that is big enough is allocated to program</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Next Fit</h5>
                        <p>Scans the memory from the location of last placement and chooses next available block
                            that is large enough</p>
                    </li>
