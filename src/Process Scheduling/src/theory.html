        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process
            from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.
            <br>
            Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems
            allow
            more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the
            CPU
            using time multiplexing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Operating System maintains the following important process scheduling queues âˆ’ </p>
        
        <li style="display:flex;"><b>Job Queue - </b>
            <p>This queue keeps all the processes in the system.</p>
        </li>
        <li style="display:flex;"><b>Ready Queue - </b>
            <p>This queue keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute. A new
                process
                is always put in this queue.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <p>The OS can use different policies to manage each queue (FIFO, Round Robin, Priority, etc.). The OS scheduler
            determines how to move processes between the ready and run queues which can only have one entry per
            processor
            core on the system.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</h2>
        <p><strong>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</strong> is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically
            executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU
            scheduling
            algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first.
            This
            is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.</p>

        <h2>Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling</h2>
        <p><strong>SJF scheduling algorithm</strong> schedules the processes according to their burst time.
            <br>
            In SJF scheduling, the process with the lowest burst time, among the list of available processes in the
            ready
            queue, is going to be scheduled next.
            <br>
            However, it is very difficult to predict the burst time needed for a process hence this algorithm is very
            difficult to implement in the system.
        </p>
        <h2>Round Robin (RR)</h2>
        <p><strong>Round Robin</strong> is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm.

            Each process is provided a fix time to execute, it is called a quantum.

            Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process executes for a given
            time period.

            Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes.</p>


        <h2>Priority Based Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Priority scheduling</strong> is a non-preemptive algorithm and one of the most common scheduling
            algorithms in batch
            systems.

            Each process is assigned a priority. Process with highest priority is to be executed first and so on.

            Processes with same priority are executed on first come first served basis.

            Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement.
        </p>



        <h2>Shortest Remaining Time</h2>
        <p><strong>Shortest remaining time (SRT)</strong> is the preemptive version of the SJN algorithm.

            The processor is allocated to the job closest to completion but it can be preempted by a newer ready job
            with shorter time to completion.

            Impossible to implement in interactive systems where required CPU time is not known.

            It is often used in batch environments where short jobs need to give preference.
        </p>

        <h2>Muliple-Level Queues Scheduling</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Multiple-level queues</strong> are not an independent scheduling algorithm. They make use of other
            existing
            algorithms to group and schedule jobs with common characteristics.

            Multiple queues are maintained for processes with common characteristics.
            Each queue can have its own scheduling algorithms.
            Priorities are assigned to each queue.
            For example, CPU-bound jobs can be scheduled in one queue and all I/O-bound jobs in another queue. The
            Process Scheduler then alternately selects jobs from each queue and assigns them to the CPU based on the
            algorithm assigned to the queue.
