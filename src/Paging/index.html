                <p >
                    Each process being executed by the CPU has instructions written. For executing each 
                    instruction one after the other, there is a special purpose register called the 
                    <b>program counter(PC)</b> which stores the address of the next instruction that is to be executed.
                    However, the address stored by PC is not the address where the instruction is stored on 
                    main memory, but an address generated by the CPU relative to the top of the process. 
                    This CPU generated address is called the <b>Logical Address</b> and the range of logical 
                    addresses that can be generated is called the <b>logical address space</b>. The actual address 
                    that points to a location on the Main Memory is called the <b>physical address</b> and the no. of 
                    physical addresses that can be used is called the <b>physical address space</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earler it was required that each process was contiguously allocated space in the Main Memory. 
                    Now however, we need not follow this rule because of the introduction of a concept known as paging. 
                    <b>Paging</b> is a technique using which the logical address space of a process is divided into 
                    equal sized segments known as <b>pages</b>. Also, the physical address space is divided into 
                    equal sized segments called <b>frames</b>. Frame size is equal to Page size. Each page of a process 
                    is mapped onto a frame in the main memory using a <b>page table</b>. This technique is used to 
                    non-contiguously allocate space in the main memory, and helps reduce external fragmentation.
